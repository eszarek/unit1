Project Cycle 1: Class portfolio management

<b>Description / Purpose:</b>
  An interface for storing, updating, and deleting courses taken during college. Courses optionally may include a
  description. The website also includes sign in/off and password update.


<b>Dependencies:</b>
  Connected to online hosting for PHPMyAdmin. Hosted locally on XAMPP and written in PHPStorm in PHP 8.1, debugged with
  XDEBUG helper. Bootstrap 5.3.0 used and JS.

<b>Usage:</b>
  This web API can be used from the front-end easily. Most of the content is locked behind user log in.
  Download Locally:
  Create a local repository copy on your system. Update your connection information on connect.php for your MySQL or
  MariaDB PDO.

<b>Future Work:</b>
  The website will continue to gain new functionality, such as a tagging and searching system for classes and live
  coding environments or a GitHub workspace plug in.

<b>My major:</b>
  I am studying information science and graphic design. So far, this project has included the usage of dynamically
  created objects and classes in PHP and HTML. The background includes CSS and JS work for an interactive piece.
  Security and injection were considered for all endpoints.
